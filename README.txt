This website is my little personal corner on the internet x).

It is meant to function as a personal blog where i can have my projects and other stuff summarized, as well as helping people connect with me on different networks.
It's built from the ground up with pure HTML/CSS/JS by choise, in order to better understand the basics and fundamentals of web design again. It offers a responsive ui on both Desktop and Mobile view as well as a functional contact form.
